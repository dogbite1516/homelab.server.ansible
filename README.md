# homelab.server.ansible
proxmox based ansible automation 

This repo contains the initial server deploy of servers, using Ansible, that will be used for kubernetes cluster on proxmox.
The base for these servers is a previously created template in proxmox.

This will be expanded out to incorporate other VMs as required in the overall contained homelab build.
