# homelab.server.ansible
~~proxmox based ansible automation~~

~~This repo contains the initial server deploy of servers, using Ansible, that will be used for kubernetes cluster on proxmox.
~~The base for these servers is a previously created template in proxmox.~~

~~This will be expanded out to incorporate other VMs as required in the overall contained homelab build.~~

Doing this from scratch was a bad Idea. Instead use **opentofu** [HERE](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) with the os flavour of your choice. 

Watch for added information when I share what I am doing to further my homelab
